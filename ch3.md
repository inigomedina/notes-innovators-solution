# WHAT PRODUCTS WILL CUSTOMERS WANT TO BUY?

But despite the best efforts of remarkably talented people, most attempts to create successful new products fail.

    Over 60 percent of all new-product development efforts are scuttled before they ever reach the market.

    Of the 40 percent that do see the light of day, 40 percent fail to become profitable and are withdrawn from the market.

    By the time you add it all up, three-quarters of the money spent in product development investments results in products that do not succeed commercially.

Once again, we argue that the failures are really not random at all: They are predictable—and avoidable—if managers get the categorization stage of theory right.

The process that marketers call market segmentation is, in our parlance, the categorization stage of theory building.

Only if managers define market segments that correspond to the circumstances in which customers find themselves when making purchasing decisions can they accurately theorize which products will connect with their customers.

We believe that this approach, based on the notion that customers “hire” products to do specific “jobs,” can help managers segment their markets to mirror the way their customers experience life.

## Pomp and Circumstances in Segmenting Markets

Much of the art of marketing focuses on segmentation: identifying groups of customers that are similar enough that the same product or service will appeal to all of them.2 Marketers often segment markets by product type, by price point, or by the demographics and psychographics of the individuals or companies who are their customers. 

The reason, in our view, is that these delineations are defined by the attributes of products and customers. As we see over and over in this book, theories based on attribute-based categorizations can reveal correlations between attributes and outcomes. But it is only when marketing theory offers a plausible statement of causality and is built upon circumstance-based categorization (segmentation) schemes that managers can confidently assert what features, functions, and positioning will cause customers to buy a product.

Predictable marketing requires an understanding of the circumstances in which customers buy or use things.

    Specifically, customers—people and companies—have “jobs” that arise regularly and need to get done.

    When customers become aware of a job that they need to get done in their lives, they look around for a product or service that they can “hire” to get the job done. This is how customers experience life.

Their thought processes originate with an awareness of needing to get something done, and then they set out to hire something or someone to do the job as effectively, conveniently, and inexpensively as possible. The functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the jobs that customers need to get done constitute the circumstances in which they buy. 

the jobs that customers are trying to get done or the outcomes that they are trying to achieve constitute a circumstance-based categorization of markets

    Put another way, the critical unit of analysis is the *circumstance* and not the customer.


Segmenting the market along demographic or psychographic lines indeed provides information on individual customers.6 But the same busy father who needs a viscous, time-consuming milkshake in the morning needs something very different later in the day for his child. When researchers asked customers who have multiple jobs in their lives what attributes of the milkshake they should improve upon, and when the researchers then averaged each consumer’s response with those of others in the same demographic or psychographic segment, it led to a one-size-fits-none product that didn’t do well any of the jobs that customers were trying to get done.

Knowing what job a product gets hired to do (and knowing what jobs are out there that aren’t getting done very well) can give innovators a much clearer road map for improving their products to beat the true competition from the customer’s perspective—in every dimension of the job.
